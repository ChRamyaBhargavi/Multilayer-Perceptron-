Breast Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning
Leveraging machine learning for early and accurate breast cancer detection.

Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify breast tumors as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on diagnostic features.

The project focuses on:

Data preprocessing and exploration to ensure high-quality input data.
Training and evaluation of three machine learning models:
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
Random Forest
Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
Performance analysis using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Cross-validation for XGBoost to assess model robustness.
Visualization of results using confusion matrices and other graphical representations.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, available in breast-cancer.csv. It consists of:

569 samples with 32 features, including the diagnosis label.
Target variable: diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign).
Features: Various numerical measurements of breast mass, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area.
